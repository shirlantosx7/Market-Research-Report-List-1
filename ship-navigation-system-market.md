<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Navigation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ENC</li><li>RNC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ship Navigation System market primarily includes two main types: Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC) and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC). ENCs are vector-based electronic charts created for use in electronic chart display and information systems (ECDIS), providing real-time data and navigation information. RNCs, on the other hand, are raster-based images of paper charts, offering a familiar navigational reference but lacking the dynamic data integration of ENCs. Both types serve crucial roles in ensuring safe and efficient maritime navigation.</p></p>
