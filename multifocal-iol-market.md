<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal IOL Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refractive Type</li><li>Diffraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) market is primarily categorized into refractive and diffraction types. Refractive multifocal IOLs utilize different lens powers to provide clear vision at various distances, optimizing focus through a combination of spherical aberration correction. In contrast, diffraction multifocal IOLs employ microstructures that split light into multiple focal points, enhancing depth of field and improving vision quality for near and distant sights. Both types aim to reduce reliance on glasses post-cataract surgery, catering to diverse patient needs.</p></p>
