<p><h1>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market Size, Growth and Forecast from 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) is a form of renal replacement therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease. It allows individuals to perform dialysis at home, utilizing the peritoneal membrane as a natural filter to remove waste and excess fluid from the blood. CAPD involves filling the abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution, allowing for the exchange of waste products and electrolytes.</p><p>The CAPD market is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing awareness of chronic kidney diseases, aging populations, and a rising prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, which are major risk factors for kidney failure. The market is also benefiting from advancements in dialysis technology, leading to improved patient outcomes and convenience. The rise in home-based healthcare solutions is further propelling CAPD’s adoption as patients seek more autonomy in managing their treatment.</p><p>Additionally, government initiatives and increased funding for kidney disease management programs are contributing to market expansion. The Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% during the forecast period, reflecting the growing demand for efficient and flexible renal care options in the healthcare system. As the market evolves, innovations in dialysis solutions and training programs for patients are anticipated.</p></p>
